# Renewal Process
## Definition
A renewal process is a counting process where the inter-arrival times are i.i.d. (proper) random variables $X_1,X_2, \cdots$. We shall assume the
non-trivial case that $X_1 \neq 0$ a.s., and (ii) $E[X_1] \leq \infty$.

$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ denote the arrival time of customer $n$.

$N(t) = \max\{n: S_n \leq t\} = \\sum_{n=1)}^\infty 1\{S_n \leq t\}$ denote the number of arrivals by time $t$.

The renewal process is probabilistic identical if starting from any time $t$.
